1)Write code that uses the string stored in org and creates an acronym which is assigned to the variable acro. Only the first letter of each word should be used, each letter in the acronym should be a capital letter, and there should be nothing to separate the letters of the acronym. Words that should not be included in the acronym are stored in the list stop. For example, if org was assigned the string “hello to world” then the resulting acronym should be “HW”.
stop = ['to', 'a', 'for', 'by', 'an', 'am', 'the', 'so', 'it', 'and', "The"]



2)Write code that uses the string and creates an acronym which is assigned to the variable A.The first two letters of each word should be used, each letter in the acronym should be a capital letter, and each element of the acronym should be separated by a “. ” (dot and space). Words that should not be included in the acronym are stored in the list stop. For example, if sent was assigned the string “height and ewok wonder” then the resulting acronym should be “HE. EW. WO”.
stop = ['to', 'a', 'for', 'by', 'an', 'am', 'the', 'so', 'it', 'and', "The"]

words=["walk","talk","play"]
past_words=["walked","talked","played"]
